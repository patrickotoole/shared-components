## Delorean Streaming Application

This application provides a streaming endpoint for what is submitted to appnexus as part of the batch segment log. 

### Usage

The application has an HTML and a websocket route. The websocket route provides streaming data for the main route of application

### TODO

- Add segment value to the grouping rather than just grouping by segment
- Pull information from MYSQL table and join this information on so we can search by domain / placement id rather than segment name
